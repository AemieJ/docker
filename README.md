##DOCKER

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. 

The basic idea of docker is divided into docker containers and docker images. Explaining it in an easy manner, there is a project idea on your local machine and want it to be available on either production level or on other PCs so you create a docker file of the project and store it as a docker image in the machine. This particular docker image can be used by any docker container and it will create the same copy on each individual container.
